# Changes for MinaProtocol

`ppx_optcomp` was forked from `janestreet/ppx_optcomp` at tag
`v0.12-preview.120.18+252`. A number of changes were made
atop that, including support for injecting imported values into
OCaml code, relative import locations, and support for compilation
with Bazel.

For OCaml 4.11.2, the Jane Street code at v0.13.0 was merged.
